## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile: More flexible, focusing on small, rapid cycles (called sprints).
Agile is like building a Lego house, one piece at a time! While Waterfall is like assembling a puzzle—step by step, from the corners inward.
Waterfall: Like a linear flow—one step finishes before the next starts.

Advantages of Agile Methodology 
 1. Flexibility & Adaptability – Agile allows for changes and new requirements to be integrated throughout development.
 2. Faster Delivery – Continuous iterations and incremental releases ensure quicker product delivery.
 3. Customer Collaboration – Frequent feedback loops improve customer satisfaction and alignment with business needs.
 4. Higher Quality – Ongoing testing and continuous integration reduce defects and improve software quality.
 5. Risk Reduction – Early and continuous testing minimizes major failures at later stages.
Disadvantages
 1. Less Predictability – Since Agile is iterative, final project scope, cost, and timeline can be uncertain.
 2. High Resource Demand – Agile requires frequent team collaboration, which can be challenging in large teams.
 3. Scope Creep – Without proper control, frequent requirement changes can lead to endless development cycles.
 4. Documentation Issues – Agile focuses more on working software than detailed documentation, which may be a problem in regulated industries.
 5. Not Ideal for Large, Complex Projects – Agile works best for small to medium-sized projects with evolving requirements.

Advantages Waterfall Methodology
  1. Clear Structure – Defined phases (Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment) provide a structured approach.
  2. Better Documentation – Comprehensive documentation ensures clarity and long-term maintainability.
  3. Predictable Budget & Timeline – Since everything is planned upfront, cost and schedule estimates are more accurate.
  4. Easier for Large, Well-Defined Projects – Works well for projects with fixed requirements and strict compliance needs.
  5. Easier Team Management – Since tasks are divided into phases, managing resources is straightforward.
Disadvantages
  1. Inflexible to Changes – Once development starts, it’s difficult to modify requirements without restarting phases.
  2. Late Testing & Risk Discovery – Bugs and issues are only identified in the testing phase, which may lead to costly fixes.
  3. Slow Delivery – The entire project must be completed before delivering a working product.
  4. Poor Customer Collaboration – Clients only see the final product, which increases the risk of unmet expectations.
  5. Not Ideal for Dynamic Environments – Works poorly in projects with rapidly changing requirements.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile works best for projects that:
  - Have changing or evolving requirements.
